## Installing for local development

1. Install Jekyll on your machine. You can install Jekyll using this guide: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. Download the master branch from the repository. ( If you downloaded a zip file, unzip it first. )
3. Go to the root of the project and open '`_config.yml`' in a text editor. Make necessary changes to the file. You may use the hints in the comments or follow the documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com). _Note: After any changes we make to this file, we need to build the site again using the command`'jekyll serve'`._
4. If you followed up the Jekyll installation using the guide in step 1, you can build up the site for first time using the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` in terminal.
5. The site would be available at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

## Setting up jekyll-vfolio on GitHub pages to host your site.
1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one.
2. Fork this repository and create a branch named gh-pages, then start editing the `_config.yml` file. Delete the `README.md` and `favicon.ico` files. You may add your own `favicon.ico` file as well.
