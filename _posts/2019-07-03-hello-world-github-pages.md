  In the upper-right corner of any page, click '+', and then click **New repository**.

- Commit new file

  In GitHub, to save a file or its changes we need to commit changes.   
  To commit, scroll down and in *Commit new file* section write up the changes or the message you might help you get to it later easily.Finally, click on **Commit new file**.

- Create *gh-pages* branch

  To use Github Pages,we need to create a new branch as **gh-pages**.   
  For this, click on *Branch:master* and type in *gh-pages*. In the dropdown option, click on *Create branch:gh-pages*.   
  If we initially had *gh-pages* branch then it will switch with the *master* branch. but since we do not have that branch it creates it.

- And testing out

  In your browser, type in `https://username.github.io/Hello-World` where username is your current Github username.   
  Finally, you can check up Hello World displayed on your browser.
